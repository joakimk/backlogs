= Backlogs Plugin for Redmine

A scrum/agile tool. Useful for product planning, sprint planning, and daily stand-ups. For a quick demo try http://backlogsdemo.morphexchange.com/projects/demo/backlogs by logging in as demo/demo

= Installation

1. Extract or clone the plugin to $REDMINE_CORE/vendor/plugins as redmine_backlogs
3. Run <tt>rake db:migrate_plugins</tt> from RAILS_ROOT
4. Restart Redmine

= Settings

You will need to enable the Backlogs module per project via Settings > Modules. Also, make check that the right roles have permission to use the module by going to Administration > Roles and Permissions > Permissions Report.

= Points sync

If you have a custom field called "Points" on the issues, that value will be kept in sync with the corresponding Backlog issue points.

= Chart Data Generator

You may schedule a cron job to run the rake task named <tt>redmine:backlogs_plugin:generate_chart_data</tt>. I recommend you run it a few minutes after midnight to ensure that your backlogs have data everyday even when no user views the charts.
